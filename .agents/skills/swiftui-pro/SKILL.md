Review Swift and SwiftUI code for correctness, modern API usage, and adherence to project conventions. Report only genuine problems - do not nitpick or invent issues.

Project context takes precedence over generic reference preferences. This repository uses SwiftUI, minimum iOS 18, Linux business-logic tests and macOS CI UI tests. Read references relative to this SKILL.md directory. Load only the files needed for the task.

Treat "always"/"never" API guidance as conditional on deployment target, framework and actual correctness. Check official Apple/Swift documentation and availability before changing code. Do not report a style preference as a bug or refactor working code solely to adopt newer syntax. New SDK APIs require a supported fallback on iOS 18. Keep SwiftUI/UIKit/XCTest out of Linux business packages.

Review process:

1. Check for deprecated API using `references/api.md`.
1. Check that views, modifiers, and animations have been written optimally using `references/views.md`.
1. Validate that data flow is configured correctly using `references/data.md`.
1. Ensure navigation is updated and performant using `references/navigation.md`.
1. Ensure the code uses designs that are accessible and compliant with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines using `references/design.md`.
1. Validate accessibility compliance including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Reduce Motion using `references/accessibility.md`.
1. Ensure the code is able to run efficiently using `references/performance.md`.
1. Quick validation of Swift code using `references/swift.md`.
1. Final code hygiene check using `references/hygiene.md`.

If doing a partial review, load only the relevant reference files.


## Core Instructions

- iOS 26 exists, but this project's deployment target is iOS 18. Wrap iOS 26-only APIs in `if #available(iOS 26, *)` with an iOS 18 fallback. [local edit]
- Target Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- As a SwiftUI developer, the user will want to avoid UIKit unless requested.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.


## Output Format

Organize findings by file. For each issue:

1. State the file and relevant line(s).
2. Name the rule being violated (e.g., "Use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`").
3. Show a brief before/after code fix.

Skip files with no issues. End with a prioritized summary of the most impactful changes to make first.

Example output:

### ContentView.swift

**Line 12: Use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.**

```swift
// Before
Text("Hello").foregroundColor(.red)

// After
Text("Hello").foregroundStyle(.red)
```

**Line 24: Icon-only button is bad for VoiceOver - add a text label.**

```swift
// Before
Button(action: addUser) {
    Image(systemName: "plus")
}

// After
Button("Add User", systemImage: "plus", action: addUser)
```

**Line 31: Prefer an existing binding when it expresses the same state and behavior.**

A custom `Binding(get:set:)` is valid for conversion, validation or proxy state. The alternative below is appropriate only when the observable model exposes a compatible binding and the save behavior remains correct; do not report the initializer itself as a defect.

```swift
// Before
TextField("Username", text: Binding(
    get: { model.username },
    set: { model.username = $0; model.save() }
))

// After
TextField("Username", text: $model.username)
    .onChange(of: model.username) {
        model.save()
    }
```

### Summary

1. **Accessibility (high):** The add button on line 24 is invisible to VoiceOver.
2. **Deprecated API (medium):** `foregroundColor()` on line 12 should be `foregroundStyle()`.
3. **Data flow (conditional):** Simplify the binding only if the existing model binding preserves the intended behavior.

End of example.
